- DON'T FORGET TO READ THE NOTES
## General Instructions
- 1, Let's move to the `Actions` tab
- 2, Choose your Custom Recovery
```bash
LineageOS Builder (Developing)
OrangeFox-RP Builder (Fixing Bugs)
OrangeFox-RP Legacy Builder (Not tested!)
PitchBlack-RP Builder
RedWolf-RP Builder
SkyHawk-RP Builder
TeamWin-RP Builder
```
- 3, Click `Run Workflow` then fill in the necessary information according to the instructions in the following table

| Workflow Dispatch | Description | Example | Find where? | Note |
| :---------------- | :---------- | :-----: | :---------: | :--: |
| **Manifest Type** | [omni](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni), [aosp](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp), [lineageos](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_lineageos) | `aosp` | Look in the tail of the Manifest link:  github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_([omni](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni)/[aosp](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp)/[lineageos](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_lineageos)) |  |
| **Manifest Branch** | Branch of Minimal Manifest (twrp-4.4-deprecated, . . . , twrp-12.1, twrp-14.1) | `twrp-12.1` | Search in the respective Manifest link |  |
| **Device Tree URL** | URL GitHub of Device Tree | https://github.com/VThang51/android_device_samsung_a13 | GitHub  (Make sure your Device Tree is error free and running smoothly) | Make sure the Repository is set as `Public` |
| **Device Tree Branch** | Branch of Device Tree | `master` | Search in Device Tree Links |  |
| **Brand** | Phone manufacturer | `samsung` | You can find it in the `BoardConfig.mk` file  DEVICE_PATH := device/`samsung`/$(DEVICE_CODENAME) |  |
| **Device Code** | Device Code is recorded in the Device tree | `a13x` | You can find it in the `BoardConfig.mk` file  DEVICE_CODENAME := `a13x` |  |
| **Makefile Type** | Look in your Device tree `<omni/twrp>_a13x.mk` | `twrp` | `twrp`_a13x.mk |
| **Add "export"** | Add `export` command if needed | `export XXXXX=1 && export YYYYY=true && export ZZZZZ=1` | Search in Minimal Manifest or [Google](http://google.com) | Adding `export ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES=true` was not necessary since I added it to the Workflow (and Don't forget to add `&&`) |
| **Build Target** | location of stock recovery on the device | `recovery` | mka `recovery`image |

### PitchBlack Recovery Project
- In your device tree, open the file omni_<device>.mk (or twrp_<device>.mk or aosp_<device>.mk) and edit `vendor/omni...` to `vendor/pb` so you won't get an issue when building!
